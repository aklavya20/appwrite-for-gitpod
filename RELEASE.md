# How to prepare a new release

To upgrade the integration for Gitpod after each Appwrite release, run the [upgrade](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting/update#install-next-version) command. This is important to ensure all services and env variables are updated as needed.

For convenience, you may use the `upgrade.sh` script in this repo to prepare a new release.
